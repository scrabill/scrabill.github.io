# scrabill.github.io - portfolio 1.0

Everyone has a first portfolio website.

Hereâ€™s mine brought back online as part of the Codette Club [First Portfolios](https://medium.com/codetteclub/first-portfolios-the-good-the-bad-and-the-why-god-why-76634fb7e8b1) project.

My current and second iteration of the site can be see at [shannoncrabill.com](http://shannoncrabill.com/). The code can be forked from [here](https://github.com/scrabill/portfolio-2.0)
